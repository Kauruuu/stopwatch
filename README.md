To build this stopwatch web application, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional and interactive timer. The HTML structures the layout, including the display for the stopwatch and buttons for starting, pausing, resetting, and recording lap times.

Using CSS, I styled the application with a clean, modern look, ensuring that the stopwatch and buttons are well-aligned and responsive to different screen sizes. Additionally, I employed flexbox for layout and used various color schemes to differentiate between the buttons for different actions.

In JavaScript, I implemented the core logic for the stopwatch. This includes functionality for:

Starting the stopwatch, which begins tracking the time and updates every 10 milliseconds.
Pausing the stopwatch, which stops the timer and allows the user to resume later.
Resetting the stopwatch to zero, clearing the recorded time and laps.
Recording lap times, which display the elapsed time at the moment the lap button is pressed.
The time is displayed in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, with millisecond precision, providing accurate time tracking for the user. Lap times are recorded and displayed below the main timer in a list format.

This application is fully interactive, allowing users to manage time intervals and record laps with a smooth and user-friendly experience.
